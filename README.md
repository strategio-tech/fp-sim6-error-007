<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
<div align="center">

<p>Creature Coders is a game designed for ages 10+ that will allow you to traverse the NYC subway system as a local New York City animal, while learning how to code in a fun and intuitive way. 

To play the game, each user picks a pet avatar and traverses the levels on our subway map inspired by NYC. The beginning games focus on logic and basic concepts, and the later games bring in some javascript syntax and code. After you win each game, you‚Äôre rewarded with points and PidgeCoins, which you can use to buy hats in the hat shop.</p>
